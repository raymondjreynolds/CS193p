# CS193p
Contains my coding projects for CS193p

I am watching the onilne recordings of CS193p and following along with the projects using this git repo to track my progress. In it contains the code to my projects as outlined in the class.

This is an independent undertaking - I did not take CS193p while at Stanford, but was interested in mobile app development and saw the lectures posted online!
